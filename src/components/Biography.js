      <p>
      Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in 1881, and was raised there before going on to spend most of his adult
       life working as an artist in France. Throughout the long course of his career, he created more than 
       20,000 paintings, drawings, sculptures, ceramics and other items such as costumes and theater sets. 
       He is universally renowned as one of the most influential and celebrated artists of the twentieth century.

      Picasso's ability to produce works in an astonishing range of styles made him well respected during 
      his own lifetime. After his death in 1973 his value as an artist and inspiration to other artists 
      has only grown. He is without a doubt destined to permanently etch himself into the fabric of humanity 
      as one of the greatest artists of all time.

      As an artist and an innovator, he is responsible for co-founding the entire Cubist movement alongside
       Georges Braque. Cubism was an avant-garde art movement that changed forever the face of European painting
        and sculpture while simultaneously affecting contemporary architecture, music and literature. Subjects
         and objects in Cubism are broken up into pieces and re-arranged in an abstract form. During the period 
         from approximately 1910-1920 when Picasso and Braque were laying the foundation for Cubism in France, 
         its effects were so far-reaching as to inspire offshoots like the styles of Futurism, Dada, and Constructivism in other countries.

      In 1900, Picasso first went to Paris, the center of the European art scene. He shared lodgings with 
      Max Jacob, a poet and journalist who took the artist under his wing. The two lived in abject poverty,
       sometimes reduced to burning the artist's paintings to stay warm.

      Before long, Picasso relocated to Madrid and lived there for the first part of 1901. He partnered with 
      his friend Francisco Asis Soler on a literary magazine called "Young Art," illustrating articles and
       creating cartoons sympathetic to the poor. By the time the first issue came out, the developing artist 
       had begun to sign his artworks "Picasso," rather than his customary "Pablo Ruiz y Picasso."

      The Picasso art period known as the Blue Period extended from 1901 to 1904. During this time,
       the artist painted primarily in shades of blue, with occasional touches of accent color.
        For example, the famous 1903 artwork, The Old Guitarist, features a guitar in warmer brown tones
         amid the blue hues. Picasso's Blue Period works are often perceived as somber due to their subdued tones.

      Historians attribute Picasso's Blue Period largely to the artist's 
      apparent depression following a friend's suicide. Some of the recurring subjects in the Blue Period are
       blindness, poverty and the female nude.

      The Rose Period lasted from 1904 through 1906. Shades of pink and rose imbued Picasso's art with a warmer,
       less melancholy air than his Blue Period paintings. Harlequins, clowns and circus folk are among the 
       recurring subjects in these artworks. He painted one of his best-selling works during the Rose Period,
        Boy with a Pipe. Elements of primitivism in the Rose Period paintings reflect experimentation with the Picasso art style.
